**Should I invest in 'x' token or project?**

## DeFi Education
**What happens if I lose my seed phrase? Can I recover my assets?**
In DeFi, one of the most significant risks is the loss of your seed phrase, which can lead to permanent loss of all assets. Without a backup, asset recovery is impossible. Ember addresses this challenge by eliminating the need to manage a seed phrase. It integrates a multi-factor authentication system, similar to those used by banks but managed entirely on-chain, enhancing both security and convenience. Ember combines the robustness of a hardware wallet with the ease of biometric authentication, backed by multiple recovery options for added safety. Our collaboration with Odsy  us to incorporate their advanced network, which uses zero-knowledge proofs for decentralized access control, ensuring the safekeeping of your assets.
